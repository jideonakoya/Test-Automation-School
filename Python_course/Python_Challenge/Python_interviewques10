Explain what polymorphism and inheritance are in python OOP

Polymorphism is the capability of many class methods to perform the same task. In this case a child class can have the same name
as the parent method but can perform different actions for each class

Inheritance is the capability of one class to inherit the attribbutes and methods from another class.
The class being inherited from is the Parent class while the class that inherits from another class is the Child class
